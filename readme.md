# ChatGPT Powered Spotify Playlist Generator (proof of concept)

### Overview

I built this app to make the process of creating a new playlist simple.

- Step 1: connect to your Spotify account
- Step 2: provide ChatGPT the genre of music for your playlist
- Step 3: click a button to automatically create the new playlist in your Spotify account and add the suggested tracks to it.

This is a proof of concept, to see if it was possible, what issues I encountered with ChatGPT, to build something (basic) of my own with React and Express etc.

### Where to from here?
